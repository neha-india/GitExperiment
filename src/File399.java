1. The alias command is built into most of the shells on Linux systems and is a way of customizing a shell.
 
2. Aliases are recognized only by the shell in which they are created, and apply only for the user who created it.
 
 3. The alias name and the replacement text can contain any valid shell input except for the equals sign (=).
 
 4. Aliases can be added to .bashrc (for bash shell) file to be made permanent.
 
 5. Remove aliases
 	
- Aliases can be removed using the unalias command: unalias [-a] name(s)
- Overwrite an existing alias by using the alias command to create a new alias with the same name.
- A third way is to delete the alias from the appropriate configuration file using a text editor.
