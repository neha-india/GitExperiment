Let’s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow that you might use in the real world. You’ll follow these steps:

    Do work on a web site.

    Create a branch for a new story you’re working on.

    Do some work in that branch.

At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:

    Switch to your production branch.

    Create a branch to add the hotfix.

    After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

    Switch back to your original story and continue working.
